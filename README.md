# TrackMate - Biometric based Smart Attendance system

In the realm of modern education, efficient attendance management is pivotal. To address the shortcomings of traditional methods, we have developed a mobile application as an integral part of our Smart Attendance System. This app seamlessly connects with NodeMCU ESP8266 and the R305 Fingerprint Scanner, offering teachers and students a convenient and secure way to manage attendance wirelessly.
